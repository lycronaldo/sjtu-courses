Being able to write an academic paper is a critical skill for graduate students. It is also an important skill that continue to serve us if we intend to enter the PhD career,  or any specific field that involves analytical writing. However, academic writing is no way an easy task as it consists of lengthy procedures of conducting thorough research and the ability to write skillfully. Therefore, we should know some basic skills of academic writing when we enter the master career. 

## 1 Introduction

This article is to introduce some of my views on academic writing in Computer Science. 

As we know, the premise of writing a great paper is to have a good idea. In the field of Computer Science, the core of the paper is the software system we built or the algorithm we implemented. Therefore, our ideas are all around software or algorithms. Once we have a new insight into a problem, we can solve it by programming, and then record the solution and experimental results, which will become a paper.

Even though we may have spent the majority of our time on writing code, a paper does not contain a description of, nor does it contain a copy of,  the  project source code. A paper describes the research work in the context of other related work. In particular, it describes the problem we are solving, our solution, our experiments and results, our contribution to the general research area, related work in the area, and future directions for our work. 

Now let's take a look at how to write an academic paper. I will divide this article into the following parts:

+ **Introduction.** This section is the introduction, which introduces the main content of this article.
+ **Choose a Topic to Research.** In this section, I will introduce some views on the topic selection.
+ **Write the Paper Step by Step.** In this section, I'm going to share some ideas about how to an complete academic paper.
+ **Summary.** This section is the summary of this article.

## 2 Choose a Topic to Research

As we know, a good research topic is half the success of the paper. From my perspective, here are some things we should do when choosing project topics in computer science.

**Look and think of ideas.** Search for ideas on websites related to the ideas generated. For example if we are thought about a political upheaval or climatic change, we could browse through sites that discuss political issues or climatic issues. As we read through these sites, we will begin to form several topics based on these ideas we already have. For example: if I thought about Electricity challenges, when I start reading about news or browsing sites on electricity in the northwest of China, I can start thinking of how to use my courses (software engineering) to solve the electricity problem. I could think about *Computerized electricity Management system.*

**Avoid over used topics. ** Be aware of overused ideas when deciding a topic. Some topics has been written on some many times, we may wish to avoid such topics unless we have a unique approach to the topic.

**Read general background books and papers. ** Read articles, journals and papers on two or three topics related to our research. This will help us get an overview of the topic and see how our ideas relate to broader, narrower, and related issues. It also provides a great source for finding words commonly used to describe the topic.

**Make a list of useful keywords. **Take note of all keywords related to our research. Look for words that best describe our topic when reading related works/topics in encyclopedias, articles and other research works.

Don't forget to follow the instructions of our mentors. If the topic requires writing applications (software) or constructing a hardware make sure that choose an area we can afford to do or complete within the time limit.

## 3 Write the Paper Step by Step

In this chapter, I will share some of my ideas about how to write a paper step by step.

### 3.1 Get the Tools Ready

The first step in writing a paper is to get the tools ready.

+ The document editor, such as Office-Word and $L^AT_EX$. These tools can help us format our papers and check spelling and grammar.
+ Drawing software. Figures and tables (display items) are often the quickest way to communicate large amounts of complex information. A good drawing software is needed to make exquisite figures and tables.
+ Note management software. In the process of writing a paper, it is inevitable to produce a lot of notes. A good note management can help us improve our efficiency.
+ Cloud backup service, e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox and Google Drive. We need to backup everything related to our paper.
+ Anything else that can help us write a paper.

It should be noted that before writing the paper, we should have a specific plan for how to write a program the solve the problem we choose.

### 3.2 Write a Paper Proposal

Writing a good proposal is an important first step to success. Proposals will differ, but there are certain things that can be expected to be found in every one. From my perspective, the paper proposal needs :

+ **The problem to be studied.** Give a statement in what research issues the study will address and in what ways.
+ **Previous work on the problem.** By clearly describing previous work, we can better describe the current limitations and the need for new methodology. It also gives us an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of the area and helps others relate our current work to other scientific areas.
+ **Research methodology.** This section explains how we are going to conduct our research and the method we choose for our research question. Explain why the specific method is suitable for the research and how will it help us attain the research goals. The research methodology will give us an organized plan for the research.
+ **The software requirements.** It should be noted that software (or algorithm) is the core of the paper. The software requirements define the boundaries of the problem. It can also prevent the paper from going off the topic we research on.
+ **Significance of the Research.** The significance of the research will identify the importance of our work. It should be mainly stated in the introductory paragraph. We should highlight how the research is beneficial to the development of specific fields in Computer Science.
+ **A schedule for tasks**. It will remind us finish the task on time.

However, the paper proposal is just a plan. It does not mean that it has to contain these parts, nor does it mean that it contains only these parts. It can be adjusted according to our actual needs, adding or deleting some sections. 

### 3.3 Write an Outline For Each Chapter

It's very important to create an outline before writing the paper. An outline can help us organize our thoughts and ideas which we think are important. An outline is considered the skeleton of backbone of any paper. Outlining before writing the rough draft will help us identify which topics are important and which information is considered supporting ideas.

Generally speaking, a standard academic paper in Computer Science consists of the following parts.

1. **Abstract.** An abstract is a short summary of the research paper, usually about a paragraph long (but it shouldn't be very long). It contains most of the following kinds of information in brief form. The body of the paper will develop and explain these ideas much more fully.
2. **Introduction.** The introduction is the big picture of our work: what, why, and how. A good introduction should lead the readers from a generalized topic to a particular aspect. It helps to establish the main idea, context, research importance and summarizes background data on the topic, providing the main goal of the work. The introduction should include the thesis statement and any background information that we might have gathered. A thesis statement is the main topic and explains to the readers what ours views are on this topic.
3. **Relative work.** This is an essential part of a paper, discussing related work is a good way to put our work in context with other similar work and to provide a way for us to compare and contrast our work to other work. It is not enough to just site related work, we need to explain to the readers in what way it is related to our work in the paper. 
4. **Our work and contribution.** In this section we can describe the actual details of our work. We should explain clearly what questions the paper are trying to answer, as well as how we decide to go about finding the answers, and we should describe in detail the solution and how it answers these questions.
5. **Experiment or evaluation.** This section should thoroughly describe the results we obtained. Whenever possible or appropriate, we should try to present the results pictorially using graphs or histograms. In addition we must explain the results and tell the reader what all these data mean.
6. **Conclusion, summary and the future work.** In this chapter, we should conclude with the main ideas and results of our work. Discuss ways in which our project could be extended..., what's the next? what are the interesting problems and questions that resulted from the current work? These questions need to be considered carefully.
7. **Acknowledgment.** A great work must be the crystallization of the wisdom of many people, don't forget to thank them at this section.
8. **References.** At the end of the paper is a Reference section listing all the papers that we cited in the paper.

### 3.4 Fill in Each Chapter

After the outline is established, we can fill in the skeleton of the paper. An important principle is that we don't have to write the chapters in order. If we are short of ideas about a chapter, we can skip it over and finish the following chapters first. Another important principle we need to keep in mind is that completion is more important than perfection.

For the abstract, introduction and related work, the writing of these chapters are relatively fixed. We can expand the details of each chapter according to the requirements of the outline.

The most important chapters are the chapter about **our work and contribution** and the chapter about  **experiment or evaluation**. 

We can express our work and contribution in the following aspects.

+ Details of the problem you are solving
+ Details of the program's architecture 
+ Details of the solution and the project's implementation
+ Details of the core algorithm(s) in the program
+ Discussion of how our solution solves the problem

As for the chapter about experiment and evaluation, we can try to express in these ways.

+ Explain the tests we designed and performed (and why)
+ Explain how we gathered the data and describe the environment in which we gathered data (include description of any program we wrote or used to run your experiments)
+ Present the experiment results. Quality is more important than quantity. The reader will be tired of pages and pages of graphs and tables, instead they want to be convinced that the results show something interesting and that the experiments support the conclusions.
+ Discuss the results. Explain and interpret the results (possibly compare them to related work). This can help readers understand the significance of our work.

It should be noted that: Don't include large pieces of source code in the paper. Even though we may have spent a long time writing code for the project, and even though we may be very proud of the simple and efficient code we wrote. The code may be appropriate to include a description of the implementation at a higher-level. Typically, a description like this would appear as a short paragraph in the Results or Implementation sections of the paper, but never copy and paste source code in the paper.

### 3.5 Iterative Revision

The completion of the first draft does not mean that the paper is finished. We need to make further revisions to the draft. 

No one can write a perfect first draft. It’s impossible - revising is critical if we want to impress the reviewers (or professors) and get a high grade for our paper. From my perspective, we should start revising the content as soon as possible.  And the revising doesn't mean revise only spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, we need to revise individual paragraphs like when we wrote them for the first time. Once the paper is drafted, make sure hand in the best possible work by checking it over thoroughly and making any necessary edits.

Read the paper and make changes to fix it and make impeccable. We can do it in a number of ways.

- Eliminate irrelevant ideas and unnecessary information
- Add new explanations, details, points to ensure additional support for our argument
- Rewrite paragraphs and sentences to present our ideas better
- Re-organize paragraphs and sentences to make our  paper logical

A good paper needs to be polished carefully, we should be ready that we may need to write more than one draft or revise our paper several times. 

## 4 Summary

Below is a quick list of the guidelines that have been discussed in this article.

+ Choose a topic to research.
+ Get the tools ready. 
+ Write the program according to the problem.
+ Start writing paper early. Don't wait until the program is finished.
+ Write a proposal that includes a statement of the problem under study, the software requirements, an indication of how the problem will be solved, and a survey of related literature.
+ Write an outline for each chapter before we write the paper.
+ Write the first draft of the paper as soon as possible. Completion is more important than perfection.
+ Polish the first draft of the paper.

Last but not least, **Do not plagiarize!**
