## How to Write an Academic Paper

Being able to write an academic paper is a critical skill for graduate students. It is also an important skill that continue to serve us if we intend to enter the PhD career,  or any specific field that involves analytical writing. However, academic writing is no way an easy task as it consists of lengthy procedures of conducting thorough research and the ability to write skillfully. Therefore, we should know the skills of academic writing before we enter the master's career. 

Here are some of my views on writing a computer science academic paper.

### Get the Tools Ready



### Write a Paper Proposal



### Write an Outline For Each Chapter

Generally speaking, a standard academic paper consists of the following parts:

1. **Abstract** - 
2. Introduction
3. Relative work
4. Our contribution
5. Experiment or evaluation
6. Summary and Future Work
7. Acknowledgment

### Fill in Each Chapter



### Further Improvement

Further improvements mainly include four parts:

1. Revise the paper
2. Revise the documents of the software system
3. Add comments as detailed as possible to the code
4. Double check whether the experimental results are consistent with analysis in the paper

No one can write a perfect first draft. It’s impossible - revising is critical if we want to impress the reviewers (or professors) and get a high grade for our work. From my opinion, we should start revising the content at least a week before our paper is due. And the revising doesn't mean revise only spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, we need to revise individual paragraphs like when we wrote them for the first time. What's more, we should be ready that we may need to write more than one draft or revise our paper several times.

Read the paper and make changes to fix it and make impeccable. We can do it in a number of ways.

- Eliminate irrelevant ideas and unnecessary information
- Add new explanations, details, points to ensure additional support for your argument
- Rewrite paragraphs and sentences to present your ideas better
- Re-organize paragraphs and sentences to make your paper logical

Once your essay is drafted, make sure you’re handing in your best possible work by checking it over thoroughly and making any necessary edits.

+ 检查语法错误
+ 润色论文的逻辑
+ 完善软件/算法的文档，添加更多的注释，以便于他人复现
+ 检查软件/算法的测试结果是否与论文所述吻合，学术不端是一个严重的问题
