### 3.4 Fill in Each Chapter



### 3.5 Further Improvement

The completion of the first draft does not mean that the paper is finished. We need to make further revisions to the draft. The further improvements may include these parts: 

​	(a) Revise the paper
​	(b) Proofread the paper
​	(c) Discuss with others

**Revise the Paper**

No one can write a perfect first draft. It’s impossible - revising is critical if we want to impress the reviewers (or professors) and get a high grade for our paper. From my perspective, we should start revising the content as soon as possible. Once your essay is drafted, make sure you’re handing in your best possible work by checking it over thoroughly and making any necessary edits. And the revising doesn't mean revise only spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, we need to revise individual paragraphs like when we wrote them for the first time. 

Read the paper and make changes to fix it and make impeccable. We can do it in a number of ways.

- Eliminate irrelevant ideas and unnecessary information
- Add new explanations, details, points to ensure additional support for your argument
- Rewrite paragraphs and sentences to present your ideas better
- Re-organize paragraphs and sentences to make your paper logical

Last but not least, a good paper needs to be polished carefully, we should be ready that we may need to write more than one draft or revise our paper several times. 

**Proofread the Paper**



**Discuss With Others**
