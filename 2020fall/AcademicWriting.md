## How to Write an Academic Paper

Being able to write an academic paper is a critical skill for graduate students. It is also an important skill that continue to serve us if we intend to enter the Phd career,  or any specific field that involves analytical writing. Here are some of my views on writing a computer science academic paper.

Generally speaking, a standard academic paper consists of the following parts:

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Relative work
4. Your contribution
5. Experiment or evaluation
6. Summary
7. Acknowledgment
