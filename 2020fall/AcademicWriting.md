Being able to write an academic paper is a critical skill for graduate students. It is also an important skill that continue to serve us if we intend to enter the PhD career,  or any specific field that involves analytical writing. However, academic writing is no way an easy task as it consists of lengthy procedures of conducting thorough research and the ability to write skillfully. Therefore, we should know some basic skills of academic writing when we enter the master career. 

## 1 Introduction

This article is to introduce some of my views on academic writing in computer science. The scope of this article is very narrow and deals only with certain features of thesis that are unique to the field of computer science. 

As we know, the premise of writing a great paper is to have a good idea. In the field of computer science, the core of the paper is the software system we built or the algorithm we implemented. Therefore, our ideas are all around software or algorithms. Once we have a new insight into a problem, we can solve it by programming, and then record the solution and experimental results, which will become a paper.

Even though we may have spent the majority of our time on writing code, a paper does not contain a description of, nor does it contain a copy of,  the  project source code. A paper describes the research work in the context of other related work. In particular, it describes the problem we are solving, our solution, our experiments and results, our contribution to the general research area, related work in the area, and future directions for our work. 

Now let's take a look at how to write an academic paper. I will divide this article into the following parts:

+ **Introduction.** This section is the introduction, which introduces the main content of this article.
+ **How to Write the Program.** In this section, I will share some of my views on how to write the programs we need, or programs the paper need.
+ **Write the Paper Step by Step.** In this section, I'm going to share some ideas about how to an complete academic paper.
+ **Summary.** This section is the summary of this article.

## 2 How to Write the Program

The program is the core of our paper. When we complete the development of the program, it is equivalent to the completion of half of the paper.

According to the software engineering theory, to build a great software system mainly needs the following 4 steps:

+ Requirement Analysis
+ System Design
+ Coding And Debugging
+ Software Testing

For the algorithm implementation, the steps are similar.

## 3 Write the Paper Step by Step

In this chapter, I will share my ideas about how to write a paper step by step.

### 3.1 Get the Tools Ready

The first step in writing a paper is to get the tools we need ready.

### 3.2 Write a Paper Proposal



### 3.3 Write an Outline For Each Chapter

It's very important to create an outline before writing the paper. An outline can help us organize our thoughts and ideas which we think are important. An outline is considered the skeleton of backbone of any paper. Outlining before writing the rough draft will help us identify which topics are important and which information is considered supporting ideas.

Generally speaking, a standard academic paper in computer science consists of the following parts.

1. **Abstract.** An abstract is a short summary of the research paper, usually about a paragraph long (but it shouldn't be very long). It contains most of the following kinds of information in brief form. The body of the paper will develop and explain these ideas much more fully.
2. **Introduction.** The introduction is the big picture of our work: what, why, and how. A good introduction should lead the readers from a generalized topic to a particular aspect. It helps to establish the main idea, context, research importance and summarizes background data on the topic, providing the main goal of the work. The introduction should include the thesis statement and any background information that we might have gathered. A thesis statement is the main topic and explains to the readers what ours views are on this topic.
3. **Relative work.** This is an essential part of a essay, discussing related work is a good way to put our work in context with other similar work and to provide a way for us to compare and contrast our work to other work. It is not enough to just site related work, we need to explain to the readers in what way it is related to our work in the paper. 
4. **Our contribution.** In this section we can describe the actual details of our thesis work. We should explain clearly what questions the paper are trying to answer, as well as how we decide to go about finding the answers, and we should describe in detail the solution and how it answers these questions.
5. **Experiment or evaluation.** This section should thoroughly describe the results we obtained. Whenever possible or appropriate, we should try to present the results pictorially using graphs or histograms. In addition we must explain the results and tell the reader what all these data mean.
6. **Conclusion, summary and the future work.** Conclude with the main ideas and results of our work. Discuss ways in which your project could be extended..., what's the next? what are the interesting problems and questions that resulted from the current work?
7. **Acknowledgment.** A great work must be the crystallization of the wisdom of many people, don't forget to thank them at this section.
8. **References.** At the end of the paper is a Reference section listing all the papers that we cited in the thesis.

### 3.4 Fill in Each Chapter

After the outline is established, we can fill in the skeleton of the paper.

### 3.5 Further Improvement

The completion of the first draft does not mean that the paper is finished. We need to make further revisions to the draft. The further improvements may include these parts: 

+ Revise the paper
+ Proofread the paper
+ Discuss with others

**Revise the Paper**

No one can write a perfect first draft. It’s impossible - revising is critical if we want to impress the reviewers (or professors) and get a high grade for our paper. From my perspective, we should start revising the content as soon as possible.  And the revising doesn't mean revise only spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, we need to revise individual paragraphs like when we wrote them for the first time. Once the essay is drafted, make sure you’re handing in the best possible work by checking it over thoroughly and making any necessary edits.

Read the paper and make changes to fix it and make impeccable. We can do it in a number of ways.

- Eliminate irrelevant ideas and unnecessary information
- Add new explanations, details, points to ensure additional support for your argument
- Rewrite paragraphs and sentences to present your ideas better
- Re-organize paragraphs and sentences to make your paper logical

Last but not least, a good paper needs to be polished carefully, we should be ready that we may need to write more than one draft or revise our paper several times. 

**Proofread the Paper**



**Discuss With Others**
