## L2: Abstract

TODO: How to write abstract.



## L3: Reading and Writing the Results

Present data in 3 stages:

- Give a **general overview** in one or two sentences.
- Present **representative data**, not the whole mass of data obtained.
- If it is necessary to provide more than the representative data, do so in an **Appendix**, not in the text of your paper.

And “A picture is worth a thousand words.”





## L4: Language Style

TODO: How to achieve the diversities of vocabulary and sentence patterns.

### Descriptive Reports

Descriptive reports first specify the class and/or type that the entity/phenomenon is classified into, or its partial/complete definition, and then describe its characteristics. In writing descriptive reports, you have to be systematic and specific on each of the features you include. Descriptive reports usually finish with an extension to incorporate all the above.

- Phase 1: Classification/Definition of Entity
- Phase 2: Description its characteristics
- Phase 3: Extension/Recapitulation



### Classifying Reports

Classifying reports classify members of a general class into types (and sub-types) according to a given set of criteria, and is structured in 3 phases as well.

The criteria may be specified or implied.

### Compositional Reports

Compositional reports are **concerned with parts of the whole**. They firstly specify the class and/or type that the entity (the whole) is classified into, or its partial/complete definition, and then its components (and their activities/functions), and usually finish with an extension in the concept to incorporate all the above.

- Phase 1: Classification of Entity
- Phase 2: Description (Components and their characteristics)
- Phase 3: Extension/Recapitulation



> Compositional reports 和 Classfying reports 看起来很相似，个人理解 Compositional reports 关注点是**某个实体**的各个组成部分，而 Classfying reports 着重于描述**某一类别的实体**。



## L6: Exposition

TODO.

The argumentative text not only appears as required in all English proficiency tests, but also is an essential part of academic papers for students in either humanity or science disciplines.

Each type of argumentation has its own particular schematic structure: 

- the exposition is arguing for a point of view (thesis + arguments + reiteration);
- the discussion is discussing two or more points of view (issue + sides + resolution).



## L7: Discussion

TODO.



## L8: Explanation

TODO.

4 types of explanations:

- sequential explanation
- factorial explanation
- consequential explanation
- conditional explanation



## L9: Procedual

TODO.
