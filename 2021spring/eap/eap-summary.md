## Summary

2021 EAP Course at SJTU.



## L2: Abstract

TODO: How to write abstract.



## L3: Reading and Writing the Results

Present data in 3 stages:

- Give a **general overview** in one or two sentences.
- Present **representative data**, not the whole mass of data obtained.
- If it is necessary to provide more than the representative data, do so in an **Appendix**, not in the text of your paper.

And “A picture is worth a thousand words.”





## L4: Language Style

TODO: How to achieve the diversities of vocabulary and sentence patterns.

## Text Types

Text Types:

- Reports
- Explanations
- Proceduals
- Argumentation

### Descriptive Reports

Descriptive reports first specify the class and/or type that the entity/phenomenon is classified into, or its partial/complete definition, and then describe its characteristics. In writing descriptive reports, you have to be systematic and specific on each of the features you include. Descriptive reports usually finish with an extension to incorporate all the above.

- Phase 1: Classification/Definition of Entity
- Phase 2: Description its characteristics
- Phase 3: Extension/Recapitulation



### Classifying Reports

Classifying reports classify members of a general class into types (and sub-types) according to a given set of criteria, and is structured in 3 phases as well.

The criteria may be specified or implied.

### Compositional Reports

Compositional reports are **concerned with parts of the whole**. They firstly specify the class and/or type that the entity (the whole) is classified into, or its partial/complete definition, and then its components (and their activities/functions), and usually finish with an extension in the concept to incorporate all the above.

- Phase 1: Classification of Entity
- Phase 2: Description (Components and their characteristics)
- Phase 3: Extension/Recapitulation



> Compositional reports 和 Descriptive reports 看起来很相似，个人理解 Compositional reports 关注点是**某个实体**的各个组成部分，而 Descriptive reports 着重于描述**某一类别的实体** 或者某一实体。



## L6-7: Exposition and Discussion

The argumentative text not only appears as required in all English proficiency tests, but also is an essential part of academic papers for students in either humanity or science disciplines.

Each type of argumentation has its own particular schematic structure: 

- the exposition is arguing for a point of view (thesis + arguments + reiteration);
- the discussion is discussing two or more points of view (issue + sides + resolution).

> 个人理解，Exposition 着重于描述同一性质的观点（均为正面或反面），而 Discussion 是平行叙述或比较多个不同性质的观点（包含正反两个方面）。
>
> - Exposition：论题 + 观点 + 复述
> - Discussion：问题 + 多个性质的观点 + 解决方案



## L8: Explanation

4 types of explanations:

- The **sequential explanation** is typically constructed as a series of events. Logical relations between events are temporal, either succeeding each other in time or happening at the same time. (时间顺序，存在先后依赖关系)
- The **factorial explanation** explains how an effect involves multiple factors. (多个影响因子共同作用，导致某个结果)
- The **consequential explanation** explains how a single factor leads to multiple consequences. (单个影响因子，导致多个结果)
- The **conditional explanation** deals with how effects are contingent (adj. 视情况而定的) on variable factors.  (基于某一实体对象，由于不同变量因子的作用，会导致不同的后果)

Schematic structure in explanation writing:

- specifying the Phenomenon (effect/cause/issue)
- the Explanation stage / the implication sequence / causes / effects / sequence of events / conditions-effects
- Extension / Significance / Recapitulation

## L9: Procedual

1. **Procedure:** instructing how to conduct an activity 

2. **Protocol**: Rules, Warning, Laws

3. **Procedural Recount**: listing the steps in which an activity was conducted

   In your chosen articles:

   - Do particular words in the Methodology mark the sequence of steps in the experiment / investigation (Procedural indicators / Transitions) (Signal words for a sequence)
   - What verbs do authors use to replace “use” / “apply” in cases of material?
   - Is a single term repeated to refer to one particular material/method?
