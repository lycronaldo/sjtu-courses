**Synopsis**

This paper describes GraphChi, a disk-based graph processing system, which can process large-scale graph on a single machine. In GraphChi, the parallel sliding window algorithm is proposed to execute advanced MLDM algorithms on just one machine.

- Vertices are numbered from 1 to n, and divided into P intervals. 

- Each interval associates with a shard on disk. A "shard" stores all the edges that have destination in the interval, and it's sorted by source-id.

- For each interval $p$ :

  - Read $shard(p)$ into memory.
  - Since edges are sorted by source-vertex (the start-point of the edge), the out-edge are store in consecutive blocks in the other shards. Read the blocks in shards containing such out-edges into memory, which requires P-1 block-reads (at most).
  - For each vertex in interval $p$, execute the update-function and the modified blocks are written to disk (this operation is done in parallel).
